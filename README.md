user.css to force Dark Mode on Ludus.com pages until they implement a native solution!

* How do I use this, Dora?
  - The Stylus extension can manage user.css files/settings in a number of environments:
    - iOS: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/userscripts/id1463298887 (You will probably have to manually paste in the css code, I can't test iOS stuff currently ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è)
    - Android: Firefox + https://add0n.com/stylus.html
    - Windows (and maybe Linux, ymmv?):
      - Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/
      - Chrome: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne
    - Use the instructions for whatever version of Stylus you got, on most you can just go here: https://userstyles.world/style/16882/ludus-dark-mode and click the "Install" button.
  - -Note- **I do _not_ recommend** the Styl*ish* extension, reportedly it is doing a lot of data harvesting.
